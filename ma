Issue Description:
We have reached the maximum limit of 1000 values for a picklist, which is proving to be a constraint for our business operations. We are interested in understanding if there is a possibility to increase this limit to accommodate our expanding data needs.

Impact:
The current limit restricts our ability to fully represent all necessary categories within our system, impacting data classification and reporting accuracy.

Request:
Could you please advise if there is a way to increase the limit of picklist values beyond 1000? Additionally, we would appreciate any guidance on the process and requirements for implementing such a change.
