I’m experiencing an issue with the FSL Mobile app where only the inventory items from child locations are visible, despite having a parent-child location hierarchy set up. The inventory items from the parent location, which should be accessible, are not appearing in the app. This is causing operational difficulties as it limits the visibility and management of inventory items. The issue persists even though the ‘Inventory Location’ and ‘Mobile Location’ settings have been enabled for the parent location.
